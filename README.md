  - Interface mock-up (interface sketches)
  - Create rules for game (how people will behave in different situations)
- Iteration II 
  - Frontend (interface creation, creating interface for using basic game functionality and templates creation)
  - Create basic account system (players are defined by nickname and do not have password)
  - Creating possibility for templates creation and storage (different people behaviours can be created and saved as templates for further using or sharing with other people)
  - Game logic full implementation (game functionality is fully created and works fine, excluding interface)
  - Graphical depiction of game process
- Iteration III 
  - Optimization of account system (password implementation, maybe something else)
