The NotEmpires game is based on 'cellular automaton' idea. In this game you can create your NotEmpires and conquer the land.
The world is made up of cells through which people can move and capturing cells. Each person has different stats (age,

Iterations
------------

- Iteration I 
  - Basic game logic creation (map creation and its processing, people logic implementation)
  - Interface mock-up (interface sketches)
  - Create rules for game (how people will behave in different situations)
  - Frontend prototype
- Iteration II 
  - Frontend (interface creation, creating interface for using basic game functionality and templates creation)
  - Create basic account system (players are defined by nickname and do not have password)
  - Creating possibility for templates creation and storage (different people behaviours can be created and saved as templates for further using or sharing with other people)
  - Game logic full implementation (game functionality is fully created and works fine, excluding interface)
  - Graphical depiction of game process
- Iteration III 
  - Optimization of account system (password implementation, maybe something else)
  - Interface functionality is completed (is added advanced people template editing, maybe something else)
